# Thermal-implant-reverse-engeneering
Testing, analyzing and hopefully hacking one of the first commercial NFC powered thermal sensor implants. 

## Findings

### About the app

- Supports temperatures outside what's possible in the human body (will show a warning message for big deviations).

### About the chip

- The chip operates fine at room temperature.

### About the installation

- The implant inside the injector is covered in a transparent viscous and sticky substance. My guess is it’s lubricant although I don’t see the point of covering the implant instead of the needle.

- Needle diameter 3 mm.
